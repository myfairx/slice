Developing set of rules that help define what *Slice Of Life* genre means.

Nowadays we see a lot of anime ranking and recoomendaions for **Slice Of lIfe** genre in anime and manga (hereadter will be refered as **SOL**).

However I saw these ranks lack a definitive rules on what truly define the genre. In **my** opinion most of them are incorrect becaouse they often mix or overlap with other genre creating a false description of what is truly considered a true SOL genre.

So how do we challange this?

Trying to define a perhaps changing rules on what is really a SOL genre in regards of japan culture presented in todays anime and manga and not confined to the old written description of the term SLICE of LIFE itself.
