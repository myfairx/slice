# Slice of Life
Developing set of rules that help define what *Slice Of Life* genre means.

Nowadays we see a lot of anime ranking and recommendations for **Slice Of lIfe** genre in anime and manga (hereafter will be refered as **SOL**).

However I saw these ranks lack a definitive rules on what truly define the genre. In **my** opinion most of them are incorrect because they often mix or overlap with other genre creating a false description of what is truly considered a true SOL genre.

So how do we challenge this?

Here I'm trying to define (perhaps) a changing rules on what is really a SOL genre in regards of Japan culture presented in todays anime and manga and not confined to the old written description of the term SLICE of LIFE itself. 

The term **CGDCT** or Cute Girl Doing Cute Things also thrown in a lot. while I do agree theres a valid point to this we also need a subset of rules that can clearly separate them.

I'm not a native english speaker, so helps in editing and ideas contribution are always welcome.
