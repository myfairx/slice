from anither site describing Nagi no Oitoma

The Pacing, Setting and Music add so much to the slice of life feels of this drama.
Nagi's long vacation is a very well-paced drama; no time is wasted but doesn't felt rushed as well.
It is entertaining enough to keep you engaged as you watch it. It also has mundane elements that if you notice would give a smile to your face like shirts worn by Nagi, 
it seems trivial, but those are valuable shirts you would find in thrift stores. Little details like this make me appreciate the drama more.
