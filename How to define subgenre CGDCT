The itle says it all 

How do we differentiate between these two genre?

comment and sample are welcomed

myfairx take: anime like Gochiusa, Tonari no Kyuuketsu, Mitsubushi Colors and Kiniro Mosaic are in this category. Perhaps the earliest appearance of the genre is Ichigo Mashimaro?

in my opinon CGDCT are SOL that upend the fuwa fuwa value, how do explain in plain words?
